The home page for the project is [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SDK for TypeScript and JavaScript](https://github.com/oracle/oci-typescript-sdk/).

## Installation

Use the following command to install this SDK:

```
npm install oci-sdk
```

Alternatively you can git clone this repo.

## Working with the SDK for TypeScript and JavaScript

To start working with the SDK for TypeScript and JavaScript, you import the service package, create a client, and then use that client to make calls. [Refer to examples section](https://github.com/oracle/oci-typescript-sdk/tree/master/examples) for examples on how to make requests.

### Configuring

Before using the SDK, set up a config file with the required credentials. See [SDK and Tool Configuration](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) for instructions.

## Organization of the SDK

The `oci-typescript-sdk` contains the following:

- **Service packages**: All packages except `common` and any other package found inside `lib`. These packages represent
  the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services supported by the SDK for TypeScript and JavaScript. Each package represents a service.
  These packages include methods to interact with the service, structs that model
  input and output parameters, and a client struct that acts as receiver for the above methods.

- **Common package**: Found in the `common` directory. The common package provides supporting functions and structs used by service packages.
  Includes HTTP request/response (de)serialization, request signing, JSON parsing, pointer to reference and other helper functions. Most of the functions
  in this package are meant to be used by the service packages.
