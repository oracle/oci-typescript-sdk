/**
 * Model Deployment Data Plane API
 * Model deployments are a managed resource in the OCI Data Science service to use to deploy machine learning models as HTTP endpoints in OCI. Deploying machine learning models as web applications (HTTP API endpoints) serving predictions in real time is the most common way that models are productionized. HTTP endpoints are flexible and can serve requests for model predictions.

For more information, see [Model Deployments](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/model-dep-about.htm)
