/**
 * A pluggable database (PDB) is portable collection of schemas, schema objects, and non-schema objects that appears to an Oracle client as a non-container database. To use a PDB, it needs to be plugged into a CDB.
 * To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized, talk to a tenancy administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
