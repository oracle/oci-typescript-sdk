 * *  If the network load balancer has no configured network security groups, then the network load balancer uses the network security groups in this list.
 * *  If the network load balancer has a list of configured network security groups, then this list replaces the existing list.
 * *  If the network load balancer has a list of configured network security groups and this list is empty, then the operation removes all of the network security groups associated with the network load balancer.

During the creation of the network load balancer, the service adds the new network load balancer to the specified network security groups.

The benefits of associating the network load balancer with network security groups include:
* <p>
*  Network security groups define network security rules to govern ingress and egress traffic for the network load balancer.
* <p>
*  The network security rules of other resources can reference the network security groups associated with the network load balancer
*    to ensure access.
