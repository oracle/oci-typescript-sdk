/**
 * OperatorAccessControl API
 * Operator Access Control enables you to control the time duration and the actions an Oracle operator can perform on your Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure.
Using logging service, you can view a near real-time audit report of all actions performed by an Oracle operator. 

Use the table of contents and search tool to explore the OperatorAccessControl API.

/**
* An Oracle operator raises access request when they need access to any infrastructure resource governed by Operator Access Control.
* The access request identifies the target resource and the set of operator actions. Access request handling depends upon the Operator Control 
* that governs the target resource, and the set of operator actions listed for approval in the access request. If all of the operator actions 
* listed in the access request are in the pre-approved list in the Operator Control that governs the target resource, then the access request is 
* automatically approved. If not, then the access request requires explicit approval from the approver group specified by the Operator Control governing the target resource.
* <p>
You can approve or reject an access request. You can also revoke the approval of an already approved access request. While creating an access request, 
* the operator specifies the duration of access. You have the option to approve the entire duration or reduce or even increase the time duration. 
* An operator can also request for an extension. The approval for such an extension is processed the same way the original access request was processed.
