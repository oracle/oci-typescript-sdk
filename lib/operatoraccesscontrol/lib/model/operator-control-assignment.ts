/**
 * OperatorAccessControl API
 * Operator Access Control enables you to control the time duration and the actions an Oracle operator can perform on your Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure.
Using logging service, you can view a near real-time audit report of all actions performed by an Oracle operator. 

Use the table of contents and search tool to explore the OperatorAccessControl API.
