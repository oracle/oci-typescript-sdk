 * Email Delivery API
 * API for the Email Delivery service. Use this API to send high-volume, application-generated
emails. For more information, see [Overview of the Email Delivery Service](/iaas/Content/Email/Concepts/overview.htm).


**Note:** Write actions (POST, UPDATE, DELETE) may take several minutes to propagate and be reflected by the API.
If a subsequent read request fails to reflect your changes, wait a few minutes and try again.
