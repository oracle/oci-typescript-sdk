/**
 * Email Delivery API
 * Use the Email Delivery API to do the necessary set up to send high-volume and application-generated emails through the OCI Email Delivery service.
For more information, see [Overview of the Email Delivery Service](/iaas/Content/Email/Concepts/overview.htm).

 **Note:** Write actions (POST, UPDATE, DELETE) may take several minutes to propagate and be reflected by the API.
 If a subsequent read request fails to reflect your changes, wait a few minutes and try again.
