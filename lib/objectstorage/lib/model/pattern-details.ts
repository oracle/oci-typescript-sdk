*     Glob patterns must be between 1 and 1024 characters.
* <p>
    The special pattern characters have the following meanings:
* <p>
    \\           Escapes the following character
*     *           Matches any string of characters.
*     ?           Matches any single character .
*     [...]       Matches a group of characters. A group of characters can be:
*                     A set of characters, for example: [Zafg9@]. This matches any character in the brackets.
*                     A range of characters, for example: [a-z]. This matches any character in the range.
*                         [a-f] is equivalent to [abcdef].
*                         For character ranges only the CHARACTER-CHARACTER pattern is supported.
*                             [ab-yz] is not valid
*                             [a-mn-z] is not valid
*                         Character ranges can not start with ^ or :
*                         To include a '-' in the range, make it the first or last character.
