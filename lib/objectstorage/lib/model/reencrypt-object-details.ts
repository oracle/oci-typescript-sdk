* The details used to re-encrypt the data encryption keys associated with an object.
* You can only specify either a kmsKeyId or an sseCustomerKey in the request payload, not both.
* If the request payload is empty, the object is encrypted using the encryption key assigned to the
* bucket. The bucket encryption mechanism can either be a master encryption key managed by Oracle or the Vault service.
* <p>
- The sseCustomerKey field specifies the customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C) that will be used to re-encrypt the data encryption keys of the
*   object and its chunks.
* <p>
- The sourceSSECustomerKey field specifies information about the customer-provided encryption key that is currently
*   associated with the object source. Specify a value for the sourceSSECustomerKey only if the object
*   is encrypted with a customer-provided encryption key.
