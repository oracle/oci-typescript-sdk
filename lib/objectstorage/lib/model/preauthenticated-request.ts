/**
* Pre-authenticated requests provide a way to let users access a bucket or an object without having their own credentials.
* When you create a pre-authenticated request, a unique URL is generated. Users in your organization, partners, or third
* parties can use this URL to access the targets identified in the pre-authenticated request.
* See [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm).
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized, talk to an
* administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
* [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
