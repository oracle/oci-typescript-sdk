/**
* Multipart uploads provide efficient and resilient uploads, especially for large objects. Multipart uploads also accommodate
* objects that are too large for a single upload operation. With multipart uploads, individual parts of an object can be
* uploaded in parallel to reduce the amount of time you spend uploading. Multipart uploads can also minimize the impact
* of network failures by letting you retry a failed part upload instead of requiring you to retry an entire object upload.
* See [Using Multipart Uploads](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Object/Tasks/usingmultipartuploads.htm).
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized,
* talk to an administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
* [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
