/**
 * The properties that define a job. Jobs perform the actions that are defined in your configuration.
 * - **Plan job**. A plan job takes your Terraform configuration, parses it, and creates an execution plan.
 * - **Apply job**. The apply job takes your execution plan, applies it to the associated stack, then executes
 * the configuration's instructions.
 * - **Destroy job**. To clean up the infrastructure controlled by the stack, you run a destroy job.
 * A destroy job does not delete the stack or associated job resources,
 * but instead releases the resources managed by the stack.
 * - **Import_TF_State job**. An import Terraform state job takes a Terraform state file and sets it as the current
 * state of the stack. This is used to migrate local Terraform environments to Resource Manager.
