/**
* Details to create a new masking policy. Use either a sensitive data model or a reference 
* target database to create your masking policy.
* <p>
To use a sensitive data model as the source of masking columns, set the columnSource
* attribute to SENSITIVE_DATA_MODEL and provide the sensitiveDataModelId attribute. After 
* creating a masking policy, you can use the AddMaskingColumnsFromSdm operation to automatically
* add all the columns from the associated sensitive data model. In this case, the target 
* database associated with the sensitive data model is used for column and masking format validations.
* <p>
You can also create a masking policy without using a sensitive data model. In this case, 
* you need to associate your masking policy with a target database by setting the columnSource 
* attribute to TARGET and providing the targetId attribute. The specified target database is 
* used for column and masking format validations.
* <p>
After creating a masking policy, you can use the CreateMaskingColumn or PatchMaskingColumns 
* operation to manually add columns to the policy. You need to add the parent columns only, 
* and it automatically adds the child columns (in referential relationship with the parent 
* columns) from the associated sensitive data model or target database.
