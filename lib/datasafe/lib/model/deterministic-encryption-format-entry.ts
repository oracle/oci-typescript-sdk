/**
* The Deterministic Encryption masking format encrypts column data using a cryptographic 
* key and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128). It can be used to encrypt character and 
* number columns. It can encrypt ASCII data without any input (except seed value), but it 
* needs a regular expression to encrypt non-ASCII data.
* <p>
Deterministic Encryption is a format-preserving, deterministic and reversible masking 
* format, which requires a seed value while submitting a masking work request. Passing 
* the same seed value when masking multiple times or masking different databases ensures 
* that the data is masked deterministically. To learn more, check Deterministic Encryption 
* in the Data Safe documentation.

  /**
    * The regular expression to be used for masking. For data with characters in the
* ASCII character set, providing a regular expression is optional. However, it 
* is required if the data contains multi-byte characters. If not provided, an 
* error is returned when a multi-byte character is found.
* <p>
In the case of ASCII characters, if a regular expression is not provided, 
* Deterministic Encryption can encrypt variable-length column values while 
* preserving their original format.
* <p>
If a regular expression is provided, the column values in all the rows must match 
* the regular expression. Deterministic Encryption supports a subset of the regular 
* expression language. It supports encryption of fixed-length strings, and does not 
* support * or + syntax of regular expressions. The encrypted values also match the 
* regular expression, which helps to ensure that the original format is preserved. 
* If an original value does not match the regular expression, Deterministic Encryption 
* might not produce a one-to-one mapping. All non-confirming values are mapped to a 
* single encrypted value, thereby producing a many-to-one mapping.
