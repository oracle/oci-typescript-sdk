* COMPARTMENT: An automatically managed assessment type that stores all details of targets in one compartment.
* This type keeps an up-to-date assessment of all database risks in one compartment. It is automatically updated when the latest assessment or refresh action is executed. It is also automatically updated when a target is deleted or move to a different compartment.
