Allowed version strings - \"v1\"
* v1's version specific schedule -<ss> <mm> <hh> <day-of-week> <day-of-month>
* Each of the above fields potentially introduce constraints. A workrequest is created only
* when clock time satisfies all the constraints. Constraints introduced:
* 1. seconds = <ss> (So, the allowed range for <ss> is [0, 59])
* 2. minutes = <mm> (So, the allowed range for <mm> is [0, 59])
* 3. hours = <hh> (So, the allowed range for <hh> is [0, 23])
* <day-of-week> can be either '*' (without quotes or a number between 1(Monday) and 7(Sunday))
* 4. No constraint introduced when it is '*'. When not, day of week must equal the given value
* <day-of-month> can be either '*' (without quotes or a number between 1 and 28)
* 5. No constraint introduced when it is '*'. When not, day of month must equal the given value
