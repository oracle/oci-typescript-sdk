/**
 * Generative AI Service Inference API
 * OCI Generative AI is a fully managed service that provides a set of state-of-the-art, customizable large language models (LLMs) that cover a wide range of use cases for text generation, summarization, and text embeddings. 

Use the Generative AI service inference API to access your custom model endpoints, or to try the out-of-the-box models to {@link #eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestChatResultChat(ENGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestChatResultChatRequest) eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestChatResultChat}, {@link #eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestGenerateTextResultGenerateText(ENGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestGenerateTextResultGenerateTextRequest) eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestGenerateTextResultGenerateText}, {@link #eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestSummarizeTextResultSummarizeText(ENGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestSummarizeTextResultSummarizeTextRequest) eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestSummarizeTextResultSummarizeText}, and {@link #eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestEmbedTextResultEmbedText(ENGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestEmbedTextResultEmbedTextRequest) eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestEmbedTextResultEmbedText}.

To use a Generative AI custom model for inference, you must first create an endpoint for that model. Use the {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatest(ENGenerative-aiLatestRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatest} to {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatestModel(ENGenerative-aiLatestModelRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatestModel} by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box model, or a previous version of a custom model, using your own data. Fine-tune the custom model on a {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiCluster(ENGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiClusterRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiCluster}. Then, create a {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiCluster(ENGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiClusterRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiCluster} with an {@link Endpoint} to host your custom model. For resource management in the Generative AI service, use the {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatest(ENGenerative-aiLatestRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatest}.

If also using top p, then the model considers only the top tokens whose probabilities add up to p percent and ignores the rest of the k tokens. For example, if k is 20, but the probabilities of the top 10 add up to .75, then only the top 10 tokens are chosen.

To eliminate tokens with low likelihood, assign p a minimum percentage for the next token's likelihood. For example, when p is set to 0.75, the model eliminates the bottom 25 percent for the next token. Set to 1 to consider all tokens and set to 0 to disable.
