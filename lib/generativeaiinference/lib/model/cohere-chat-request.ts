/**
 * Generative AI Service Inference API
 * OCI Generative AI is a fully managed service that provides a set of state-of-the-art, customizable large language models (LLMs) that cover a wide range of use cases for text generation, summarization, and text embeddings. 

Use the Generative AI service inference API to access your custom model endpoints, or to try the out-of-the-box models to {@link #eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestChatResultChat(ENGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestChatResultChatRequest) eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestChatResultChat}, {@link #eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestGenerateTextResultGenerateText(ENGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestGenerateTextResultGenerateTextRequest) eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestGenerateTextResultGenerateText}, {@link #eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestSummarizeTextResultSummarizeText(ENGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestSummarizeTextResultSummarizeTextRequest) eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestSummarizeTextResultSummarizeText}, and {@link #eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestEmbedTextResultEmbedText(ENGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestEmbedTextResultEmbedTextRequest) eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestEmbedTextResultEmbedText}.

To use a Generative AI custom model for inference, you must first create an endpoint for that model. Use the {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatest(ENGenerative-aiLatestRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatest} to {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatestModel(ENGenerative-aiLatestModelRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatestModel} by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box model, or a previous version of a custom model, using your own data. Fine-tune the custom model on a {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiCluster(ENGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiClusterRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiCluster}. Then, create a {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiCluster(ENGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiClusterRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiCluster} with an {@link Endpoint} to host your custom model. For resource management in the Generative AI service, use the {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatest(ENGenerative-aiLatestRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatest}.

It maintains core protections by aiming to reject harmful or illegal suggestions, but it allows profanity and some toxic content, sexually explicit and violent content, and content that contains medical, financial, or legal information. Contextual mode is suited for entertainment, creative, or academic use.
   * Strict: Aims to avoid sensitive topics, such as violent or sexual acts and profanity. This mode aims to provide a safer experience by prohibiting responses or recommendations that it finds inappropriate. Strict mode is suited for corporate use, such as for corporate communications and customer service.
   * Off: No safety mode is applied.
