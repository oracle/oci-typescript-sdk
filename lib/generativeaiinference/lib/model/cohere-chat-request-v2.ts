/**
 * Generative AI Service Inference API
 * OCI Generative AI is a fully managed service that provides a set of state-of-the-art, customizable large language models (LLMs) that cover a wide range of use cases for text generation, summarization, and text embeddings. 

Use the Generative AI service inference API to access your custom model endpoints, or to try the out-of-the-box models to {@link #eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestChatResultChat(ENGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestChatResultChatRequest) eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestChatResultChat}, {@link #eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestGenerateTextResultGenerateText(ENGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestGenerateTextResultGenerateTextRequest) eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestGenerateTextResultGenerateText}, {@link #eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestSummarizeTextResultSummarizeText(ENGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestSummarizeTextResultSummarizeTextRequest) eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestSummarizeTextResultSummarizeText}, and {@link #eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestEmbedTextResultEmbedText(ENGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestEmbedTextResultEmbedTextRequest) eNGenerative-ai-inferenceLatestEmbedTextResultEmbedText}.

To use a Generative AI custom model for inference, you must first create an endpoint for that model. Use the {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatest(ENGenerative-aiLatestRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatest} to {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatestModel(ENGenerative-aiLatestModelRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatestModel} by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box model, or a previous version of a custom model, using your own data. Fine-tune the custom model on a {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiCluster(ENGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiClusterRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiCluster}. Then, create a {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiCluster(ENGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiClusterRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatestDedicatedAiCluster} with an {@link Endpoint} to host your custom model. For resource management in the Generative AI service, use the {@link #eNGenerative-aiLatest(ENGenerative-aiLatestRequest) eNGenerative-aiLatest}.

Contextual mode is suited for entertainment, creative, or academic use.
   * Strict: Aims to avoid sensitive topics, such as violent or sexual acts and profanity. This mode aims to provide a safer experience by prohibiting responses or recommendations that it finds inappropriate. Strict mode is suited for corporate use, such as for corporate communications and customer service.
