   * object.  The bulk operation will be successful only when all attributes in the bulk request are processed successfully and they get a success status back.
   * The following are successful status values of individual attribute items in a bulk update attribute operation.
   * ATTRIBUTE_UPDATED - The attribute's properites have been updated with the given properties.
   * DUPLICATE_ATTRIBUTE - The attribute is a duplicate of an attribute that was present in this bulk request.  Note that we deduplicate the attribute collection, process only unique attributes,
   * and call out duplicates.  A duplicate attribute in a bulk request will not prevent the processing of further attributes in the bulk operation.
   * The following values are error statuses and the bulk processing is stopped when the first error is encountered.
   * INVALID_ATTRIBUTE - The attribute is invalid.
   * ATTRIBUTE_NOT_PROCESSED - The attribute was not processed, as there was another attribute in this bulk request collection that resulted in a processing error.
   * ATTRIBUTE_DOES_NOT_EXIST - Attribute was neither active nor pinned inactive.
   * ATTRIBUTE_UPDATE_NOT_ALLOWED - Attribute update is not allowed as it is an in-built system attribute.
