 * Replications are the primary resource that governs the policy of cross-region replication between source

 * located in another availability domain in the same or different region.
 * The replication retrieves the delta of data between two snapshots of a source file system
 * and sends it to the associated `ReplicationTarget`, which applies it to the target
 * file system. For more information, see [File System Replication](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/File/Tasks/FSreplication.htm).
