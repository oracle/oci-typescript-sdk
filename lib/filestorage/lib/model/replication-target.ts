/**
 * Replication targets are associated with a primary resource called a {@link Replication}
 * located in another availability domain in the same or different region.
 * The replication retrieves the delta of data between two snapshots of a source file system
 * and sends it to the associated `ReplicationTarget`,  which applies it to the target
 * file system.
 * All operations (except `DELETE`) must be done using the associated replication resource.
 * Deleting a `ReplicationTarget` allows the target file system to be exported.
 * Deleting a `ReplicationTarget` does not delete the associated `Replication` resource, but places it in a `FAILED` state.
 * For more information, see [File System Replication](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/File/Tasks/FSreplication.htm).
