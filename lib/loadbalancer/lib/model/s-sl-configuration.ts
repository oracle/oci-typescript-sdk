* *  If the `GET` operation on a listener returns `oci-customized-ssl-cipher-suite` as the value of this field,

  /**
    * A list of SSL protocols the load balancer must support for HTTPS or SSL connections.
* <p>
The load balancer uses SSL protocols to establish a secure connection between a client and a server. A secure
* connection ensures that all data passed between the client and the server is private.
* <p>
The Load Balancing service supports the following protocols:
* <p>
*  TLSv1
* *  TLSv1.1
* *  TLSv1.2
* <p>
If this field is not specified, TLSv1.2 is the default.
* <p>
**Warning:** All SSL listeners created on a given port must use the same set of SSL protocols.
* <p>
**Notes:**
* <p>
*  The handshake to establish an SSL connection fails if the client supports none of the specified protocols.
* *  You must ensure compatibility between the specified SSL protocols and the ciphers configured in the cipher
*    suite.
* *  For all existing load balancer listeners and backend sets that predate this feature, the `GET` operation
*    displays a list of SSL protocols currently used by those resources.
* <p>
example: `[\"TLSv1.1\", \"TLSv1.2\"]`
