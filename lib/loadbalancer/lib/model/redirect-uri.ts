/**
* An object that defines the redirect URI applied to the original request. The object property values compose the
* redirect URI.
* <p>
**NOTE:** The Load Balancing service cannot automatically detect or avoid infinite redirects. Be sure to provide
* meaningful, complete, and correct field values. If any component field of this object has no value, the system
* retains the value from the incoming HTTP request URI.
* <p>
For example, if you specify only the protocol field `https`, and the incoming request URI is
* `http://example.com:8080`, the resulting runtime redirect URI is `https://example.com:8080`. The system retains
* the host and port from the incoming URI and does not automatically change the port setting from `8080` to `443`.
* <p>
Be sure to configure valid percent-encoding (URL encoding) when needed.
* <p>
In addition to static string values, you can use the following tokens to construct the redirect URI. These tokens
* extract values from the incoming HTTP request URI.
* <p>
*  {protocol} : The protocol from the incoming HTTP request URI.
* *  {host}     : The domain name from the incoming HTTP request URI.
* *  {port}     : The port from the incoming HTTP request URI.
* *  {path}     : The path from the incoming HTTP request URI.
* *  {query}    : The query string from the incoming HTTP request URI.
* <p>
The tokens are case sensitive. For example, `{host}` is a valid token, but `{HOST}` is not.
* <p>
You can retain the literal characters of a token when you specify values for the path and query properties of the
* redirect URI. Use a backslash (\\\\) as the escape character for the \\\\, {, and } characters. For example, if the
* incoming HTTP request URI is `/video`, the path property value:
* <p>
`/example{path}123\\{path\\}`
* <p>
appears in the constructed redirect URI as:
* <p>
`/example/video123{path}`
*

*  HTTP

When this value is null, not set, or set to `{host}`, the service preserves the original domain name from the

* <p>
All RedirectUri tokens are valid for this property. You can use any token more than once.
* <p>
Curly braces are valid in this property only to surround tokens, such as `{host}`
* <p>
Examples:
* <p>
*  **example.com** appears as `example.com` in the redirect URI.
* <p>
*  **in{host}** appears as `inexample.com` in the redirect URI if `example.com` is the hostname in the
*    incoming HTTP request URI.
* <p>
*  **{port}{host}** appears as `8081example.com` in the redirect URI if `example.com` is the hostname and
*    the port is `8081` in the incoming HTTP request URI.

  /**
    * The communication port to use in the redirect URI.
* <p>
Valid values include integers from 1 to 65535.
* <p>
When this value is null, the service preserves the original port from the incoming HTTP request URI.
* <p>
Example: `8081`
*  Note: Numbers greater than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER will result in rounding issues.

  "port"?: number;
  /**
    * The HTTP URI path to use in the redirect URI.
* <p>
When this value is null, not set, or set to `{path}`, the service preserves the original path from the
* incoming HTTP request URI. To omit the path from the redirect URI, set this value to an empty string, \"\".
* <p>
All RedirectUri tokens are valid for this property. You can use any token more than once.
* <p>
The path string must begin with `/` if it does not begin with the `{path}` token.
* <p>
Examples:
* <p>
*  __/example/video/123__ appears as `/example/video/123` in the redirect URI.
* <p>
*  __/example{path}__ appears as `/example/video/123` in the redirect URI if `/video/123` is the path in the
*    incoming HTTP request URI.
* <p>
*  __{path}/123__ appears as `/example/video/123` in the redirect URI if `/example/video` is the path in the
*    incoming HTTP request URI.
* <p>
*  __{path}123__ appears as `/example/video123` in the redirect URI if `/example/video` is the path in the
*    incoming HTTP request URI.
* <p>
*  __/{host}/123__ appears as `/example.com/123` in the redirect URI if `example.com` is the hostname
*    in the incoming HTTP request URI.
* <p>
*  __/{host}/{port}__ appears as `/example.com/123` in the redirect URI if `example.com` is the hostname and
*    `123` is the port in the incoming HTTP request URI.
* <p>
*  __/{query}__ appears as `/lang=en` in the redirect URI if the query is `lang=en` in the incoming HTTP
*    request URI.
* 
    */
  "path"?: string;
  /**
    * The query string to use in the redirect URI.
* <p>
When this value is null, not set, or set to `{query}`, the service preserves the original query parameters
* from the incoming HTTP request URI.
* <p>
All `RedirectUri` tokens are valid for this property. You can use any token more than once.
* <p>
If the query string does not begin with the `{query}` token, it must begin with the question mark (?) character.
* <p>
You can specify multiple query parameters as a single string. Separate each query parameter with an ampersand
* (&) character. To omit all incoming query parameters from the redirect URI, set this value to an empty
* string, \"\".
* <p>
If the specified query string results in a redirect URI ending with `?` or `&`, the last character is truncated.
* For example, if the incoming URI is `http://host.com:8080/documents` and the query property value is
* `?lang=en&{query}`, the redirect URI is `http://host.com:8080/documents?lang=en`. The system
* truncates the final ampersand (&) because the incoming URI included no value to replace the {query} token.
* <p>
Examples:
* * **lang=en&time_zone=PST** appears as `lang=en&time_zone=PST` in the redirect URI.
* <p>
* **{query}** appears as `lang=en&time_zone=PST` in the redirect URI if `lang=en&time_zone=PST` is the query
*   string in the incoming HTTP request. If the incoming HTTP request has no query parameters, the `{query}`
*   token renders as an empty string.
* <p>
* **lang=en&{query}&time_zone=PST** appears as `lang=en&country=us&time_zone=PST` in the redirect URI if
*   `country=us` is the query string in the incoming HTTP request. If the incoming HTTP request has no query
*   parameters, this value renders as `lang=en&time_zone=PST`.
* <p>
*  **protocol={protocol}&hostname={host}** appears as `protocol=http&hostname=example.com` in the redirect
*    URI if the protocol is `HTTP` and the hostname is `example.com` in the incoming HTTP request.
* <p>
*  **port={port}&hostname={host}** appears as `port=8080&hostname=example.com` in the redirect URI if the
*    port is `8080` and the hostname is `example.com` in the incoming HTTP request URI.
