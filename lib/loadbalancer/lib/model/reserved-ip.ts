    * Ocid of the Reserved IP/Public Ip created with VCN.

Reserved IPs are IPs which already registered using VCN API.

Create a reserved Public IP and then while creating the load balancer pass the ocid of the reserved IP in this
* field reservedIp to attach the Ip to Load balancer. Load balancer will be configured to listen to traffic on this IP.

Reserved IPs will not be deleted when the Load balancer is deleted. They will be unattached from the Load balancer.
