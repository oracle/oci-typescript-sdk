/**
* An object that represents the action of returning a specified response code when the requested HTTP method is not in
* the list of allowed methods for the listener. The load balancer does not forward a disallowed request to the back end
* servers. The default response code is `405 Method Not Allowed`.
* <p>
If you set the response code to `405` or leave it blank, the system adds an \"allow\" response header that contains a
* list of the allowed methods for the listener. If you set the response code to anything other than `405` (or blank),
* the system does not add the \"allow\" response header with a list of allowed methods.
* <p>
This rule applies only to HTTP listeners. No more than one `ControlAccessUsingHttpMethodsRule` object can be present in
* a given listener.

    * The list of HTTP methods allowed for this listener.

By default, you can specify only the standard HTTP methods defined in the

* see a list of supported standard HTTP methods in the Load Balancing service documentation at
* [Managing Rule Sets](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Balance/Tasks/managingrulesets.htm).
* <p>
Your backend application must be able to handle the methods specified in this list.
* <p>
The list of HTTP methods is extensible. If you need to configure custom HTTP methods, contact
* [My Oracle Support](http://support.oracle.com/) to remove the restriction for your tenancy.

Example: [\"GET\", \"PUT\", \"POST\", \"PROPFIND\"]
