/**
 * BOOT_VOLUME_REPLACE cycling swaps the boot volume on the same node, while INSTANCE_REPLACE cycling deletes and recreates a new node with the changes applied.
 * Only a subset of fields (kubernetesVersion, imageId, bootVolumeSizeInGBs, nodeMetadata, sshPublicKey) can be changed with BOOT_VOLUME_REPLACE cycling.
 * The cycling operation will attempt to bring all nodes in the NodePool in sync with the NodePool specification. If BOOT_VOLUME_REPLACE cycling mode is chosen, and the node needs changes to fields that can not be updated via a BOOT_VOLUME_REPLACE cycle, the cycle attempt for that node will fail. The operation has to be retried with cycle mode changed to INSTANCE_REPLACE in this case.
