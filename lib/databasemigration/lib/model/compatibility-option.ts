/**
 * Compatibility option.
 * FORCE_INNODB - Change CREATE TABLE statements to use the InnoDB storage engine
 *   for any tables that do not already use it.
 * SKIP_INVALID_ACCOUNTS - Remove user accounts created with external authentication plugins
 *   that are not supported in MySQL HeatWave Service.
 * STRIP_DEFINERS - Remove the DEFINER clause from views, routines, events, and triggers, so these
 *   objects are created with the default definer.
 * STRIP_RESTRICTED_GRANTS - Remove specific privileges that are restricted by MySQL HeatWave Service
 *   from GRANT statements, so users and their roles cannot be given these privileges
 * STRIP_TABLESPACES - Remove the TABLESPACE clause from CREATE TABLE statements,
 *   so all tables are created in their default tablespaces.
 * IGNORE_WILDCARD_GRANTS - Ignore errors from grants on schemas with wildcards, which are interpreted
 *   differently in systems where the partial_revokes system variable is enabled.
 * STRIP_INVALID_GRANTS - Strip grant statements which would fail when users are loaded.
 *   Such as grants referring to a specific routine which does not exist.
