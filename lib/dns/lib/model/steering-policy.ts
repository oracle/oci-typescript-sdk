  /**
    * A set of predefined rules based on the desired purpose of the steering policy. Each
* template utilizes Traffic Management's rules in a different order to produce the desired
* results when answering DNS queries.
* <p>

* **Example:** The `FAILOVER` template determines answers by filtering the policy's answers
* using the `FILTER` rule first, then the following rules in succession: `HEALTH`, `PRIORITY`,
* and `LIMIT`. This gives the domain dynamic failover capability.
* <p>

* It is **strongly recommended** to use a template other than `CUSTOM` when creating
* a steering policy.
* <p>

* All templates require the rule order to begin with an unconditional `FILTER` rule that keeps
* answers contingent upon `answer.isDisabled != true`, except for `CUSTOM`. A defined
* `HEALTH` rule must follow the `FILTER` rule if the policy references a `healthCheckMonitorId`.
* The last rule of a template must must be a `LIMIT` rule. For more information about templates
* and code examples, see [Traffic Management API Guide](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/TrafficManagement/Concepts/trafficmanagementapi.htm).
* <p>
**Template Types**
* <p>
* `FAILOVER` - Uses health check information on your endpoints to determine which DNS answers
* to serve. If an endpoint fails a health check, the answer for that endpoint will be removed
* from the list of available answers until the endpoint is detected as healthy.
* <p>

* * `LOAD_BALANCE` - Distributes web traffic to specified endpoints based on defined weights.
* <p>

* * `ROUTE_BY_GEO` - Answers DNS queries based on the query's geographic location. For a list of geographic
* locations to route by, see [Traffic Management Geographic Locations](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/TrafficManagement/Reference/trafficmanagementgeo.htm).
* <p>

* * `ROUTE_BY_ASN` - Answers DNS queries based on the query's originating ASN.
* <p>

* * `ROUTE_BY_IP` - Answers DNS queries based on the query's IP address.
* <p>

* * `CUSTOM` - Allows a customized configuration of rules.
