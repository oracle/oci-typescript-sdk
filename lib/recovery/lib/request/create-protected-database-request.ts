 * Indicates if the request is to test the preparedness for creating a protected database, without actually creating a protected database.
* <p>
If you set the {@code opcDryRun} option as {@code true}, then Recovery Service only performs a test run to check for any missing prerequisites or configurations required to create a protected database, and then returns error messages to warn you about any missing requirements.
* <p>
If an error occurs, you can review, correct, and repeat the dry run until the {@code createProtectedDatabase} request does not return any errors.
* <p>
These are the common issues that you can identify by performing a dry run of the {@code createProtectedDatabase} request:
* <p>
* The Recovery Service subnet has insufficient free IP addresses to support the required number of private endpoints. See, [troubleshooting](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/recovery-service/dbrsu/troubleshoot-backup-failures-recovery-service.html#GUID-05FA08B8-421D-4E52-B84B-7AFB84ADECF9) information
* * Recovery Service does not have permissions to manage the network resources in a chosen compartment
* * Recovery Service is out of capacity. See, [Service Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm) for more information
* * Recovery Service resources exceed quota limits
* * A protected database, having the same database ID, already exists
* * The specified protection policy does not exist, or it is not in an Active state
* * The specified Recovery Service subnet does not exist, or it is not in an Active state
* <p>
See, [Prerequisites for Using Recovery Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/recovery-service/dbrsu/backup-recover-recovery-service.html#GUID-B2ABF281-DFF8-4A4E-AC85-629801AAF36A) for more information.
