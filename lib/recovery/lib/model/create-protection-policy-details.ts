  /**
   * An RFC3339 formatted datetime string that specifies the exact date and time for the retention lock to take effect and permanently lock the retention period defined in the policy.
   * <p>
   * The retention lock feature controls whether Recovery Service strictly preserves backups for the duration defined in a policy. Retention lock is useful to enforce recovery window compliance and to prevent unintentional modifications to protected database backups.
   * * Recovery Service enforces a 14-day delay before the retention lock set for a policy can take effect. Therefore, you must set policyLockedDateTime  to a date that occurs 14 days after the current date.
   * * For example, assuming that the current date is Aug 1, 2023 9 pm, you can set policyLockedDateTime  to '2023-08-15T21:00:00.600Z' (Aug 15, 2023, 9:00 pm), or greater.
   * * During the 14-day delay period, you can either increase or decrease the retention period in the policy.
   * * However, you are only allowed to increase the retention period on or after the retention lock date.
   * * You cannot change the value of policyLockedDateTime if the retention lock is already in effect.
