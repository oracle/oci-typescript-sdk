/**
 * Work Requests API
 * Many of the API operations that you use to create and configure Compute resources do not take effect
immediately. In these cases, the operation spawns an asynchronous workflow to fulfill the request.
Work requests provide visibility into the status of these in-progress, long-running workflows.

For more information about work requests and the operations that spawn work requests, see
[Viewing the State of a Compute Work Request](/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/viewingworkrequestcompute.htm).
