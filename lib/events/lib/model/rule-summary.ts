    * A filter that specifies the event that will trigger actions associated with this rule. A few 
* important things to remember about filters:
* <p>
* Fields not mentioned in the condition are ignored. You can create a valid filter that matches
* all events with two curly brackets: `{}` 
* <p>
  For more examples, see 
* [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm).       
* * For a condition with fields to match an event, the event must contain all the field names 
* listed in the condition. Field names must appear in the condition with the same nesting 
* structure used in the event. 
* <p>
  For a list of reference events, see 
* [Services that Produce Events](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Reference/eventsproducers.htm).       
* * Rules apply to events in the compartment in which you create them and any child compartments. 
* This means that a condition specified by a rule only matches events emitted from resources in 
* the compartment or any of its child compartments. 
* * Wildcard matching is supported with the asterisk (*) character. 
* <p>
  For examples of wildcard matching, see 
* [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm)

Example: `\\\"eventType\\\": \\\"com.oraclecloud.databaseservice.autonomous.database.backup.end\\\"`
