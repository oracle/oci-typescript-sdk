/**
 * Identity Domains API
 * Use the Identity Domains API to manage resources within an identity domain, for example, users, dynamic resource groups, groups, and identity providers. For information about managing resources within identity domains, see [Identity and Access Management (with identity domains)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/home.htm).
Use this pattern to construct endpoints for identity domains: `https://<domainURL>/admin/v1/`. See [Finding an Identity Domain URL](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/locate-identity-domain-url.htm) to locate the domain URL you need.
Use the table of contents and search tool to explore the Identity Domains API.

 * Clients MAY execute queries without passing parameters on the URL by using the HTTP POST verb combined with the **.search** path extension. The inclusion of **.search** on the end of a valid SCIM endpoint SHALL be used to indicate the HTTP POST verb is intended to be a query operation. To create a new query result set, a SCIM client sends an HTTP POST request to the desired SCIM resource endpoint (ending in **.search**). The body of the POST request MAY include any of the parameters.
