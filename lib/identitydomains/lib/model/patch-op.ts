/**
 * See [Section 3.5.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-scim-api-19#section-3.5.2). HTTP PATCH is an OPTIONAL server function that enables clients to update one or more attributes of a SCIM resource using a sequence of operations to \"add\", \"remove\", or \"replace\" values. Clients may discover service provider support for PATCH by querying the service provider configuration. The general form of the SCIM patch request is based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Patch [RFC6902]. One difference between SCIM patch and JSON patch is that SCIM servers do not support array indexing and do not support [RFC6902] operation types relating to array element manipulation such as \"move\". A patch request, regardless of the number of operations, SHALL be treated as atomic. If a single operation encounters an error condition, the original SCIM resource MUST be restored, and a failure status SHALL be returned.
