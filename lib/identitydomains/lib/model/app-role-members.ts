/**
 * Identity Domains API
 * Use the Identity Domains API to manage resources within an identity domain, for example, users, dynamic resource groups, groups, and identity providers. For information about managing resources within identity domains, see [Identity and Access Management (with identity domains)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/home.htm).
Use this pattern to construct endpoints for identity domains: {@code https://<domainURL>/admin/v1/}. See [Finding an Identity Domain URL](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/locate-identity-domain-url.htm) to locate the domain URL you need.
Use the table of contents and search tool to explore the Identity Domains API.
