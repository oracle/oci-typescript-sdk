 * Replace the current instance of Rule with provided payload.
* <p>
Before you specify an attribute-value in a request to replace a resource, please check the **'mutability'** property of that attribute in the resource-type schema below. Clicking on an attribute-row will expand that row to show the **SCIM++ Properties** of that attribute.
* - Your request to create, update or replace a resource may specify in its payload a value for any attribute that is defined as *mutability:readWrite* or *mutability:writeOnly* or *mutability:immutable*:
*   - The SCIM APIs to create a resource will ignore silently any value that you specify for an attribute that is defined as *mutability:readOnly*.
*   - The SCIM APIs to update or replace a resource will fail with an error 400 Bad Request if you specify a value for an attribute that is defined as *mutability:readOnly*.
*   - Similarly, the SCIM APIs to update or replace a resource will fail with an error 400 Bad Request if you specify any value for an attribute that is defined as *mutability:immutable* and that already has a value in the specified resource.
* <p>
Also, before you use the query-parameter attributes to request specific attributes, please check the **'returned'** property of that attribute in the resource-type schema below:
* - Your request to read a resource (or to search a resource-type) can specify as the value of attributes any attributes that are defined as *returned:default* or *returned:request* or *returned:always*:
*   - If you request a specific set of attributes, the SCIM APIs to read a resource (or to search a resource-type) will return in each resource the set of attributes that you requested, as well as any attribute that is defined as *returned:always*.
*   - If you do not request a specific set of attributes, the SCIM APIs to read a resource (or to search a resource-type) will return in each resource the the set of attributes defined as *returned:default*, as well as any attribute that is defined as *returned:always*.
*   - The SCIM APIs to read a resource (or to search a resource-type) will ignore silently any request to return an attribute that is defined as *returned:never*.
