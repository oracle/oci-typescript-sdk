Clients should use 'targetType' and 'targets' to specify the target type and list of targets on which the budget is applied.

For backwards compatibility, 'targetCompartmentId' is still supported for all existing clients.
* This is considered deprecated, however, and all clients are upgraded to use 'targetType' and 'targets'.

Specifying both 'targetCompartmentId' and 'targets' causes a Bad Request.
