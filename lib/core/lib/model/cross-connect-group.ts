/**
* For use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect. A cross-connect group
* is a link aggregation group (LAG), which can contain one or more
* {@link CrossConnect}. Customers who are colocated with
* Oracle in a FastConnect location create and use cross-connect groups. For more
* information, see [FastConnect Overview](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm).
* <p>
**Note:** If you're a provider who is setting up a physical connection to Oracle so customers
* can use FastConnect over the connection, be aware that your connection is modeled the
* same way as a colocated customer's (with `CrossConnect` and `CrossConnectGroup` objects, and so on).
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
