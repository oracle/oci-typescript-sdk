/**
* For use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect.
* <p>
A virtual circuit is an isolated network path that runs over one or more physical
* network connections to provide a single, logical connection between the edge router
* on the customer's existing network and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. *Private*
* virtual circuits support private peering, and *public* virtual circuits support
* public peering. For more information, see [FastConnect Overview](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm).
* <p>
Each virtual circuit is made up of information shared between a customer, Oracle,
* and a provider (if the customer is using FastConnect via a provider). Who fills in
* a given property of a virtual circuit depends on whether the BGP session related to
* that virtual circuit goes from the customer's edge router to Oracle, or from the provider's
* edge router to Oracle. Also, in the case where the customer is using a provider, values
* for some of the properties may not be present immediately, but may get filled in as the
* provider and Oracle each do their part to provision the virtual circuit.
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
* talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
* [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
* <p>
**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you
* supply string values using the API.
