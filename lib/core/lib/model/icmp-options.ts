/**
* Optional and valid only for ICMP and ICMPv6. Use to specify a particular ICMP type and code
* as defined in:
* - [ICMP Parameters](http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-parameters.xhtml)
* - [ICMPv6 Parameters](https://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters/icmpv6-parameters.xhtml)
* <p>
If you specify ICMP or ICMPv6 as the protocol but omit this object, then all ICMP types and
* codes are allowed. If you do provide this object, the type is required and the code is optional.
* To enable MTU negotiation for ingress internet traffic via IPv4, make sure to allow type 3 (\"Destination
* Unreachable\") code 4 (\"Fragmentation Needed and Don't Fragment was Set\"). If you need to specify
* multiple codes for a single type, create a separate security list rule for each.
