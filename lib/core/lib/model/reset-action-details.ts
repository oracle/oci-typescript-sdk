* <p>
If the instance has a date in the Maintenance reboot field and you do nothing (or set this flag to `false`), the instance
* will be rebuilt at the scheduled maintenance time. The instance will experience 2-6 hours of downtime during the
* maintenance process. The local NVMe-based SSD will be preserved.
* <p>
If you want to minimize downtime and can delete the SSD, you can set this flag to `true` and proactively reboot the
* instance before the scheduled maintenance time. The instance will be reboot migrated to a healthy host and the SSD will be
* deleted. A short downtime occurs during the migration.
* <p>
**Caution:** When `true`, the SSD is permanently deleted. We recommend that you create a backup of the SSD before proceeding.
