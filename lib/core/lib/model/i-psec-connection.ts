/**
* A connection between a DRG and CPE. This connection consists of multiple IPSec
* tunnels. Creating this connection is one of the steps required when setting up
* a Site-to-Site VPN.
* <p>
**Important:**  Each tunnel in an IPSec connection can use either static routing or BGP dynamic
* routing (see the {@link IPSecConnectionTunnel} object's
* `routing` attribute). Originally only static routing was supported and
* every IPSec connection was required to have at least one static route configured.
* To maintain backward compatibility in the API when support for BPG dynamic routing was introduced,
* the API accepts an empty list of static routes if you configure both of the IPSec tunnels to use
* BGP dynamic routing. If you switch a tunnel's routing from `BGP` to `STATIC`, you must first
* ensure that the IPSec connection is configured with at least one valid CIDR block static route.
* Oracle uses the IPSec connection's static routes when routing a tunnel's traffic *only*
* if that tunnel's `routing` attribute = `STATIC`. Otherwise the static routes are ignored.
* <p>
For more information about the workflow for setting up an IPSec connection, see
* [Site-to-Site VPN Overview](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/overviewIPsec.htm).
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
* talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
* [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
