/**
* A virtual network interface card. Each VNIC resides in a subnet in a VCN.
* An instance attaches to a VNIC to obtain a network connection into the VCN
* through that subnet. Each instance has a *primary VNIC* that is automatically
* created and attached during launch. You can add *secondary VNICs* to an
* instance after it's launched. For more information, see
* [Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm).
* <p>
Each VNIC has a *primary private IP* that is automatically assigned during launch.
* You can add *secondary private IPs* to a VNIC after it's created. For more
* information, see {@link #createPrivateIp(CreatePrivateIpRequest) createPrivateIp} and
* [IP Addresses](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPaddresses.htm).
