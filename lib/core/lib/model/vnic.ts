/**
* A virtual network interface card. Each VNIC resides in a subnet in a VCN.
* An instance attaches to a VNIC to obtain a network connection into the VCN
* through that subnet. Each instance has a *primary VNIC* that is automatically
* created and attached during launch. You can add *secondary VNICs* to an
* instance after it's launched. For more information, see
* [Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm).
* <p>
Each VNIC has a *primary private IP* that is automatically assigned during launch.
* You can add *secondary private IPs* to a VNIC after it's created. For more
* information, see {@link #createPrivateIp(CreatePrivateIpRequest) createPrivateIp} and
* [IP Addresses](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPaddresses.htm).
* <p>

* If you are an Oracle Cloud VMware Solution customer, you will have secondary VNICs
* that reside in a VLAN instead of a subnet. These VNICs have other differences, which
* are called out in the descriptions of the relevant attributes in the `Vnic` object.
* Also see {@link Vlan}.
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
* talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
* [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
