/**
* A remote peering connection (RPC) is an object on a DRG that lets the VCN that is attached
* to the DRG peer with a VCN in a different region. *Peering* means that the two VCNs can
* communicate using private IP addresses, but without the traffic traversing the internet or
* routing through your on-premises network. For more information, see
* [VCN Peering](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/VCNpeering.htm).
