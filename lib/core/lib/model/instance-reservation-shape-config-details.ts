* The shape configuration requested when launching instances in a compute capacity reservation.

If the parameter is provided, the reservation is created with the resources that you specify. If some
* properties are missing or the parameter is not provided, the reservation is created
* with the default configuration values for the `shape` that you specify.

Each shape only supports certain configurable values. If the values that you provide are not valid for the
* specified `shape`, an error is returned.
