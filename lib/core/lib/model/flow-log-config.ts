/**
* *Flow logs* record information about traffic that is either allowed or rejected by the
* {@link SecurityList} that control traffic in and out of a
* {@link Vnic}.
* <p>
A *flow log configuration* (`FlowLogConfig`) contains information about where to store flow
* logs (an Object Storage bucket in your tenancy), and the type of logs to store.
* <p>
**Important:** For logs to be placed in the Object Storage bucket listed in the configuration,
* an administrator must create an IAM policy in your tenancy that lets the Networking service
* put objects in that bucket. Otherwise, no flow logs can be written to the bucket.
* Here's the required policy (which consists of three separate statements):
* <p>
`define tenancy VcnFlowLogs as ocid1.tenancy.oc1..<var>&lt;unique_ID&gt;</var>`
* <p>
`define dynamic-group FlowLogsDynamicGroup as ocid1.dynamicgroup.oc1..<var>&lt;unique_ID&gt;</var>`
* <p>
`admit dynamic-group FlowLogsDynamicGroup of tenancy VcnFlowLogs to manage objects in tenancy where target.bucket.name='yourbucketname'`
* <p>
To enable flow logs for a subnet: after creating a flow
* log configuration, attach the flow log configuration to that subnet. See
* {@link FlowLogConfigAttachment} and
* {@link #createFlowLogConfigAttachment(CreateFlowLogConfigAttachmentRequest) createFlowLogConfigAttachment}.
* <p>
**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you
* supply string values using the API.
