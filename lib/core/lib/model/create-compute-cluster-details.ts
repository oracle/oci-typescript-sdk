* The data for creating a [compute cluster](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/compute-clusters.htm). A compute cluster

After the compute cluster is created, you can use the compute cluster's OCID with the

Use compute clusters when you want to manage instances in the cluster individually in the RDMA network group.

For details about creating a cluster network that uses instance pools to manage groups of identical instances,
