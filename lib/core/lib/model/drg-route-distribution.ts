/**
* A route distribution establishes how routes get imported into DRG route tables and exported through the DRG attachments.
* <p>
A route distribution is a list of statements. Each statement consists of a set of matches, all of which must be `True` in order for
* the statement's action to take place. Each statement determines which routes are propagated.
* <p>
You can assign a route distribution as a route table's import distribution. The statements in an import
* route distribution specify how how incoming route advertisements through a referenced attachment or all attachments of a certain type are inserted into the route table.
* <p>
You can assign a route distribution as a DRG attachment's export distribution. Export route distribution statements specify how routes in a
* DRG attachment's assigned table are advertised out through the attachment. When a DRG attachment is created, a route distribution is created with a
* single ACCEPT statement with match criteria MATCH_ALL.
* Exporting routes through VCN attachments is unsupported, so no VCN attachments are assigned an export distribution.
* <p>
The two auto-generated DRG route tables (one as the default for VCN attachments, and the other for all other types of attachments)
* are each assigned an auto generated import route distribution. The default VCN table's import distribution has a single statement with match criteria MATCH_ALL to import routes from
* each DRG attachment type. The other table's import distribution has a statement to import routes from attachments with the VCN type.
* <p>
The route distribution is always in the same compartment as the DRG.
