/**
* A route distribution establishes how routes get imported into DRG route tables and exported through the DRG attachments.
* <p>
A route distribution is a list of statements. Each statement consists of a set of matches, all of which must be {@code True} for the statement's action to take place. Each statement determines which routes are propagated.
* <p>
You can assign a route distribution as a route table's import distribution. The statements in an import
* route distribution specify how how incoming route advertisements through a referenced attachment or all attachments of a certain type are inserted into the route table.
* <p>
You can assign a route distribution as a DRG attachment's export distribution unless the
* attachment has the type {@code VCN}. Exporting routes through a VCN attachment is unsupported. Export
* route distribution statements specify how routes in a DRG attachment's assigned table are
* advertised out through the attachment. When a DRG is created, a route distribution is created
* with a single ACCEPT statement with match criteria MATCH_ALL. By default, all DRG attachments
* (except for those of type VCN), are assigned this distribution. You can't create a new export route distribution, one is created for you when the DRG is created.
* <p>

* The two auto-generated DRG route tables (one as the default for VCN attachments, and the other for all other types of attachments)
* are each assigned an auto generated import route distribution. The default VCN table's import distribution has a single statement with match criteria MATCH_ALL to import routes from
* each DRG attachment type. The other table's import distribution has a statement to import routes from attachments with the VCN type.
* <p>
The route distribution is always in the same compartment as the DRG.
