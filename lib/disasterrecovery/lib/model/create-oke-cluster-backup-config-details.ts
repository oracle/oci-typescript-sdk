* <p>
The backup frequency can be HOURLY, DAILY, WEEKLY or MONTHLY, and the upper and lower interval bounds are as follows

*     - Minimum = 1
*     - Maximum = 24
*   DAILY
*     - Minimum = 1
*     - Maximum = 30

*     - Minimum = 1
*     - Maximum = 1
*   MONTHLY
*     - Minimum = 1
*     - Maximum = 12
* <p>
Examples: 
*         FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE;BYHOUR=10;INTERVAL=1 -> Run a backup every Monday and Wednesday at 10:00 AM.
*         FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE;BYHOUR=10;INTERVAL=2 -> Invalid configuration (Cannot specify an interval of 2).
* <p>
        FREQ=HOURLY;INTERVAL=25 -> Invalid configuration (Cannot specify an interval of 25).
*         FREQ=HOURLY;INTERVAL=0 -> Invalid configuration (Cannot specify an interval of 0).
*         FREQ=HOURLY;INTERVAL=24 -> Run a backup every 24 hours.
*         FREQ=HOURLY;INTERVAL=1 -> Run a backup every hour.
*         FREQ=HOURLY;BYMINUTE=30;INTERVAL=15 -> Run a backup every 15 hours at the 30th minute.
*         
*         FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=31 -> Invalid configuration (Cannot specify an interval of 31).
*         FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=0 -> Invalid configuration (Cannot specify an interval of 0).
