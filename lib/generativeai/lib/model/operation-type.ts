/**
 * Generative AI Service Management API
 * OCI Generative AI is a fully managed service that provides a set of state-of-the-art, customizable large language models (LLMs) that cover a wide range of use cases for text generation, summarization, and text embeddings. 

Use the Generative AI service management API to create and manage {@link DedicatedAiCluster}, {@link Endpoint}, {@link Model}, and {@link WorkRequest} in the Generative AI service. For example, create a custom model by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box model using your own data, on a fine-tuning dedicated AI cluster. Then, create a hosting dedicated AI cluster with an endpoint to host your custom model. 

To access your custom model endpoints, or to try the out-of-the-box models to generate text, summarize, and create text embeddings see the [Generative AI Inference API](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/generative-ai-inference/latest/).

To learn more about the service, see the [Generative AI documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/generative-ai/home.htm).
