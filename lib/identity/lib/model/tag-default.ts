/**
* Tag defaults let you specify a default tag (tagnamespace.tag=\"value\") to apply to all resource types
* in a specified compartment. The tag default is applied at the time the resource is created. Resources
* that exist in the compartment before you create the tag default are not tagged. The `TagDefault` object
* specifies the tag and compartment details.
* <p>
Tag defaults are inherited by child compartments. This means that if you set a tag default on the root compartment
* for a tenancy, all resources that are created in the tenancy are tagged. For more information about
* using tag defaults, see [Managing Tag Defaults](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Tagging/Tasks/managingtagdefaults.htm).

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
