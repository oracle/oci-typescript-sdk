/**
* A collection of related resources. Compartments are a fundamental component of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
* for organizing and isolating your cloud resources. You use them to clearly separate resources for the purposes
* of measuring usage and billing, access (through the use of IAM Service policies), and isolation (separating the
* resources for one project or business unit from another). A common approach is to create a compartment for each
* major part of your organization. For more information, see
* [Overview of IAM](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com//Content/Identity/getstarted/identity-domains.htm) and also
* [Setting Up Your Tenancy](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/settinguptenancy.htm).
* <p>
To place a resource in a compartment, simply specify the compartment ID in the \"Create\" request object when
* initially creating the resource. For example, to launch an instance into a particular compartment, specify
* that compartment's OCID in the `LaunchInstance` request. You can't move an existing resource from one
* compartment to another.
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
* talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access,
* see [Get Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/policiesgs/get-started-with-policies.htm).
* <p>
**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values
* using the API.
