/**
* A dynamic group defines a matching rule. Every bare metal or virtual machine instance is deployed with an instance certificate.
* The certificate contains metadata about the instance. This includes the instance OCID and the compartment OCID, along
* with a few other optional properties. When an API call is made using this instance certificate as the authenticator,
* the certificate can be matched to one or multiple dynamic groups. The instance can then get access to the API
* based on the permissions granted in policies written for the dynamic groups.
* <p>
This works like regular user/group membership. But in that case, the membership is a static relationship, whereas
* in a dynamic group, the membership of an instance certificate to a dynamic group is determined during runtime.
* For more information, see [Managing Dynamic Groups](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/dynamicgroups/managingdynamicgroups.htm).
* <p>
**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using
* the API.
