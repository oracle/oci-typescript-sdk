/**
* A mapping between a single group defined by the identity provider (IdP) you're federating with
* and a single IAM Service {@link Group} in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
* For more information about group mappings and what they're for, see
* [Identity Providers and Federation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/federation.htm).
* <p>
A given IdP group can be mapped to zero, one, or multiple IAM Service groups, and vice versa.
* But each `IdPGroupMapping` object is between only a single IdP group and IAM Service group.
* Each `IdPGroupMapping` object has its own OCID.
* <p>
**Note:** Any users who are in more than 50 IdP groups cannot be authenticated to use the Oracle
* Cloud Infrastructure Console.
