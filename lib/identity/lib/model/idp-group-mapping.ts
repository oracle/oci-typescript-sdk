 * Identity and Access Management Service API
 * Use the Identity and Access Management Service API to manage users, groups, identity domains, compartments, policies, tagging, and limits. For information about managing users, groups, compartments, and policies, see [Identity and Access Management (without identity domains)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm). For information about tagging and service limits, see [Tagging](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm) and [Service Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm). For information about creating, modifying, and deleting identity domains, see [Identity and Access Management (with identity domains)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/home.htm).
