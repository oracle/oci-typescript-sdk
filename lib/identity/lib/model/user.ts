/**
* An individual employee or system that needs to manage or use your company's Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
* resources. Users might need to launch instances, manage remote disks, work with your cloud network, etc. Users
* have one or more IAM Service credentials ({@link ApiKey},
* {@link UIPassword}, {@link SwiftPassword} and
* {@link AuthToken}).
* For more information, see [User Credentials](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/usercred/usercredentials.htm)). End users of your
* application are not typically IAM Service users, but for tenancies that have identity domains, they might be. 
* For conceptual information about users and other IAM Service components, see [Overview of IAM](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/getstarted/identity-domains.htm).
* <p>
These users are created directly within the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure system, via the IAM service.
* They are different from *federated users*, who authenticate themselves to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
* Console via an identity provider. For more information, see
* [Identity Providers and Federation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/federation.htm).
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
* talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access,
* see [Get Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/policiesgs/get-started-with-policies.htm).
* <p>
**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values
* using the API.
