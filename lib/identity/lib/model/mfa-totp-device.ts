/**
 * Users can enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for their own user accounts. After MFA is enabled, the
 * user is prompted for a time-based one-time password (TOTP) to authenticate before they can sign in to the
 * Console. To enable multi-factor authentication, the user must register a mobile device with a TOTP authenticator app
 * installed. The registration process creates the `MfaTotpDevice` object. The registration process requires
 * interaction with the Console and cannot be completed programmatically. For more information, see
 * [Managing Multi-Factor Authentication](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/mfa/understand-multi-factor-authentication.htm).
