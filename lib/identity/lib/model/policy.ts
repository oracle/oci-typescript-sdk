/**
* A document that specifies the type of access a group has to the resources in a compartment. For information about
* policies and other IAM Service components, see
* [Overview of IAM](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/getstarted/identity-domains.htm). If you're new to policies, see
* [Get Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/policiesgs/get-started-with-policies.htm).
* <p>
The word \"policy\" is used by people in different ways:
* <p>
  * An individual statement written in the policy language
*   * A collection of statements in a single, named \"policy\" document (which has an Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) assigned to it)
*   * The overall body of policies your organization uses to control access to resources
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
* talk to an administrator.
* <p>
**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values
* using the API.
