/**
* A collection of users who all need the same type of access to a particular set of resources or compartment.
* For conceptual information about groups and other IAM Service components, see
* [Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).
* <p>
If you're federating with an identity provider (IdP), you need to create mappings between the groups
* defined in the IdP and groups you define in the IAM service. For more information, see
* [Identity Providers and Federation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/federation.htm). Also see
* {@link IdentityProvider} and
* {@link IdpGroupMapping}.
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
* talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access,
* see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
* <p>
**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values
* using the API.
