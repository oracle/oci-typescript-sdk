 * Full glossary details. A glossary of business terms, such as 'Customer', 'Account', 'Contact' , 'Address',

 * may be hierarchical where some terms may contain child terms to allow them to be used as 'taxonomies'.
 * By linking data assets, data entities, and attributes to glossaries and glossary terms, the glossary can act as a
 * way of organizing data catalog objects in a hierarchy to make a large number of objects more navigable and easier to
 * consume. Objects in the data aatalog, such as data assets or data entities, may be linked to any level in the
 * glossary, so that the glossary can be used to browse the available data according to the business model of the
 * organization.
