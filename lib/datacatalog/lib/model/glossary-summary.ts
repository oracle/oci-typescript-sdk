 * Summary of a glossary. A glossary of business terms, such as 'Customer', 'Account', 'Contact', 'Address',
 * or 'Product', with definitions, used to provide common meaning across disparate data assets. Business glossaries
 * may be hierarchical where some terms may contain child terms to allow them to be used as 'taxonomies'.
 * By linking data assets, data entities, and attributes to glossaries and glossary terms, the glossary can act as a
 * way of organizing data catalog objects in a hierarchy to make a large number of objects more navigable and easier to
 * consume. Objects in the data catalog, such as data assets or data entities, may be linked to any level in the
 * glossary, so that the glossary can be used to browse the available data according to the business model of the
 * organization.
