/**
 * A term workflow is a sequence of steps or tasks usually done by a data steward as part of the governance lifecycle.
 * Business terms cannot be used for tagging unless they are APPROVED by the busines term owner (usually a data steward).
 * By default, most terms, when created, are in the NEW status unless specified otherwise.
 * NEW           - This is the default workflow status when a term is newly created. The owner can override this status during the creation.
 * APPROVED      - This term is ready for use. It can be used to tag data assets, data entities, attributes, and other taggable resources.
 * UNDER_REVIEW  - The term is currently under review and cannot be used until it is in APPROVED status.
 * ESCALATED     - The review of this term is escalated to fast track for use in tagging.
