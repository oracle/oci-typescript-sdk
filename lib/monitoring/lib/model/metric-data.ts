/**
 * Monitoring API
 * Use the Monitoring API to manage metric queries and alarms for assessing the health, capacity, and performance of your cloud resources.
Endpoints vary by operation. For PostMetric, use the `telemetry-ingestion` endpoints; for all other operations, use the `telemetry` endpoints.
For information about monitoring, see [Monitoring Overview](/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm).

/**
* The set of aggregated data returned for a metric.
* For information about metrics, see [Metrics Overview](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#MetricsOverview).
* <p>
Limits information for returned data follows.
* <p>
* Data points: 100,000.
* * Metric streams* within data points: 2,000.
* * Time range returned for 1-day resolution: 90 days.
* * Time range returned for 1-hour resolution: 90 days.
* * Time range returned for 5-minute resolution: 30 days.
* * Time range returned for 1-minute resolution: 7 days.
* <p>
*A metric stream is an individual set of aggregated data for a metric with zero or more dimension values.
* Metric streams cannot be aggregated across metric groups.
* A metric group is the combination of a given metric, metric namespace, and tenancy for the purpose of determining limits.
* For more information about metric-related concepts, see [Monitoring Concepts](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#concepts).
