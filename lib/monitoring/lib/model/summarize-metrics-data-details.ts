/**
 * Monitoring API
 * Use the Monitoring API to manage metric queries and alarms for assessing the health, capacity, and performance of your cloud resources.
Endpoints vary by operation. For PostMetricData, use the `telemetry-ingestion` endpoints; for all other operations, use the `telemetry` endpoints.
For more information, see
[the Monitoring documentation](/iaas/Content/Monitoring/home.htm).

    * The Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression to use when searching for metric data points to

* You can optionally specify dimensions and grouping functions.
* When specifying a dimension value, surround it with double quotes, and escape each double quote with a backslash ({@code \\}) character.
* Supported grouping functions: {@code grouping()}, {@code groupBy()}.

Construct your query to avoid exceeding limits on returned data. See {@link MetricData}.

For details about Monitoring Query Language (MQL), see
* [Monitoring Query Language (MQL) Reference](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Reference/mql.htm).
* For available dimensions, review the metric definition for the supported service. See
* [Supported Services](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#SupportedServices).
