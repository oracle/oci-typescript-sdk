/**
 * Monitoring API
 * Use the Monitoring API to manage metric queries and alarms for assessing the health, capacity, and performance of your cloud resources.
Endpoints vary by operation. For PostMetricData, use the `telemetry-ingestion` endpoints; for all other operations, use the `telemetry` endpoints.
For more information, see
[the Monitoring documentation](/iaas/Content/Monitoring/home.htm).

The duration is specified as a string in ISO 8601 format ({@code PT10M} for ten minutes or {@code PT1H}

    * The Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression to evaluate for the alarm. The Alarms feature of
* the Monitoring service interprets results for each returned time series as Boolean values,
* where zero represents false and a non-zero value represents true. A true value means that the trigger
* rule condition has been met. The query must specify a metric, statistic, interval, and trigger
* rule (threshold or absence). Supported values for interval depend on the specified time range. More
* interval values are supported for smaller time ranges. You can optionally
* specify dimensions and grouping functions. Supported grouping functions: {@code grouping()}, {@code groupBy()}.
* For information about writing MQL expressions, see
* [Editing the MQL Expression for a Query](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/query-metric-mql.htm).
* For details about MQL, see
* [Monitoring Query Language (MQL) Reference](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Reference/mql.htm).
* For available dimensions, review the metric definition for the supported service. See
