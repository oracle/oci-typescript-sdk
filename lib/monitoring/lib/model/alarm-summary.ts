 * Monitoring API
 * Use the Monitoring API to manage metric queries and alarms for assessing the health, capacity, and performance of your cloud resources.
Endpoints vary by operation. For PostMetric, use the `telemetry-ingestion` endpoints; for all other operations, use the `telemetry` endpoints.
For information about monitoring, see [Monitoring Overview](/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm).

    * The Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression to evaluate for the alarm. The Alarms feature of

* rule condition has been met. The query must specify a metric, statistic, interval, and trigger
* rule (threshold or absence). Supported values for interval depend on the specified time range. More
* interval values are supported for smaller time ranges. Supported grouping functions: `grouping()`, `groupBy()`.
* For details about Monitoring Query Language (MQL), see [Monitoring Query Language (MQL) Reference](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Reference/mql.htm).
