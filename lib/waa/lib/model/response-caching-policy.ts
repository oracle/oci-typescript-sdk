  /**
    * When false, responses will not be cached by the backend based on response headers.
* <p>
When true, responses that contain one of the supported cache control headers will be cached according to the
* values specified in the cache control headers.
* <p>
The \"X-Accel-Expires\" header field sets caching time of a response in seconds. The zero value disables
* caching for a response. If the value starts with the @ prefix, it sets an absolute time in seconds since
* Epoch, up to which the response may be cached.
* <p>
If the header does not include the \"X-Accel-Expires\" field, parameters of caching may be set in the header
* fields \"Expires\" or \"Cache-Control\".
* <p>
If the header includes the \"Set-Cookie\" field, such a response will not be cached.
* <p>
If the header includes the \"Vary\" field with the special value \"*\", such a response will not be cached. If the
* header includes the \"Vary\" field with another value, such a response will be cached taking into account the
* corresponding request header fields.
