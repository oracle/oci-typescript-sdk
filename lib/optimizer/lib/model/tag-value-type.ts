/**
 * Specifies which tag value types in the `tagValues` field result in overrides of the recommendation criteria. Allowed values are `ANY` and `VALUE`.
* <p>
When the `tagValueType` field value is `ANY`, the `tagValues` field should be empty, which enforces overrides to the recommendation for resources with any tag values attached to them.
* When the `tagValueType` field value is `VALUE`, the `tagValues` field must include a specific value or list of values. Overrides to the recommendation criteria only occur for resources that match the values in the `tagKey` and the `tagValues` fields.
* <p>
For example, if the `tagKey` value is `B`, the `tagValueType` value is `ANY`, and the `tagValues` field is empty, overrides to the recommendation criteria occur for any resources that have the tag key B.
* If the `tagKey` value is `B`, the `tagValueType` value is `VALUE`, and the `tagValues` value is `s1`, overrides to the recommendation criteria only occur for resources that have the tag key B with the associated tag value s1.
