/**
 * The manner in which the root or subordinate certificate authority (CA) is generated and managed. CA configuration types include the following:
 * - Root CA generated internally by the service (ROOT_CA_GENERATED_INTERNALLY). You provide the details required to generate a certificate, including the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Key Management service (KMS) hardware-protected, asymmetric encryption key. Using this information, the Certificates service creates the root CA certificate which is then signed by the OCI KMS private key.
 * - Subordinate CA issued by a CA that was generated internally by the service (SUBORDINATE_CA_ISSUED_BY_INTERNAL_CA). You provide the details required to generate a certificate, including the OCI KMS hardware-protected, asymmetric encryption key. Using this information, the Certificates service creates the subordinate CA certificate which is then signed by the OCI KMS private key you specified and the OCI KMS private key of the issuer CA.
 * - Root CA imported to the service (ROOT_CA_MANAGED_EXTERNALLY). You import the root CA certificate in PEM format without the certificate's private key. Private keys are managed externally by OCI KMS Dedicated KMS (DKMS), an on-premises key management solution, or a third-party cloud provider. This type of CA can't directly issue certificates or subordinate CAs. Instead, for any certificates or subordinate CAs you want to issue, the service generates a CSR that you must sign externally and then import.
 * - Subordinate CA issued by a CA that was generated externally, but where you manage keys in OCI (SUBORDINATE_CA_MANAGED_INTERNALLY_ISSUED_BY_EXTERNAL_CA). You import the key of the subordinate CA certificate to OCI KMS. You then provide the details required to generate a CSR that you must sign externally by using the private key of the external parent CA. During this time, the CA remains in a {@code PENDING_ACTIVATION} lifecycle state. To complete activation, import the signed certificate. This type of subordinate CA can issue certificates and subordinate CAs of its own.
