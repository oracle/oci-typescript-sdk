 * A list of possible rotation states for the certificate version. A certificate version marked `CURRENT` is currently in use. A certificate version marked `PENDING` is staged and available for use, but has not been applied on the target system and, therefore, has not been rotated
 * into current, active use. The certificate most recently uploaded to the service is always marked `LATEST`. (The first version of a certificate is always marked as both `CURRENT` and `LATEST`.) A certificate version marked `PREVIOUS` is the certificate version that was most recently marked `CURRENT`, before the last certificate version rotation.
 * A certificate version marked `DEPRECATED` is neither current, pending, nor the previous one in use. Only certificate versions marked `DEPRECATED` can be scheduled for deletion.
