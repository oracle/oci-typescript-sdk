/**
 * The objective of the IORM plan of a storage server. The following is excerpt from Exadata document:
 * auto - Use this setting for IORM to determine the best mode based on active workloads and resource plans.
 *        IORM continuously and dynamically determines the optimization objective, based on the observed workloads
 *        and enabled resource plans. This is the recommended value for most use cases, and starting with
 *        Oracle Exadata System Software release 21.2.0, this is the default setting.
 * high_throughput - Use this setting to optimize critical DSS workloads that require high throughput.
 *       This setting improves throughput at the cost of I/O latency.
 * low_latency - Use this setting to optimize critical OLTP workloads that require extremely good disk latency.
 *       This setting provides the lowest possible latency at the cost of throughput by limiting disk utilization.
 * balanced - Use this setting for a mixture of critical OLTP and DSS workloads. This setting balances low disk
 *       latency and high throughput. This setting limits disk utilization of large I/Os to a lesser extent than
 *       low_latency to achieve a balance between latency and throughput.
 * basic - Use this setting to limit the maximum small I/O latency and otherwise disable I/O prioritization.
 *       This is the default setting in Oracle Exadata System Software release 20.1.0 and earlier.
 * other - Temporarily handle the case when exadata side adds new value, should not be used as input
 *       when to make change to IORM plan.
