/**
* An OPSI configuration resource is a container for storing custom values for customizable configuration items exposed by Operations Insights.
* <p>
Operations Insights exposes different sets of customizable configuration items through different OPSI configuration types.
* UX_CONFIGURATION: OPSI configuration resource of this type can be created only once in each compartment. It is a compartment level singleton resource.
* <p>
When configuration values, for an OPSI configuration type that supports compartment level singleton (e.g: UX_CONFIGURATION) resource, are queried for a compartment,
* following will be the order of preference.
* 1. If the specified compartment has an OPSI configuration resource, first preference will be given to the custom values inside that.
* 2. If the root compartment has an OPSI configuration resource, it will be considered as applicable to all compartments of that tenency,
* hence second preference will be given to the custom values inside that.
* 3. Default configuration will be considered as a final fallback option.
