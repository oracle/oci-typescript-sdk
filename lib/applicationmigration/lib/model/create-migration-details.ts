/**
 * Application Migration API
 * Application Migration simplifies the migration of applications from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Classic to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
You can use Application Migration API to migrate applications, such as Oracle Java Cloud Service, SOA Cloud Service, and Integration Classic
instances, to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. For more information, see
[Overview of Application Migration](/iaas/application-migration/appmigrationoverview.htm).

/**
* While creating a migration, specify the source and the application that you want migrate.
* Each migration moves a single application from a specified source to a specified Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy.
* If required, provide the credentials of the application administrator in the source environment.
* Application Migration uses this information to access the application, as well as discover application artifacts,
* such as the complete domain configuration along with data sources and other dependencies.
* <p>
You must also assign a name and provide a description for the migration.
* This helps you to identify the appropriate source environment when you have multiple sources defined.
* <p>
**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.
