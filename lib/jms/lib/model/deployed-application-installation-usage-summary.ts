/**
 * Summarize usage information about an application deployed on Java servers including installation information during a specified time period. The main difference between DeployedApplicationInstallationUsageSummary and DeployedApplicationUsage is the presence of the applicationSourcePath. DeployedApplicationUsage provides only an aggregated view to the deployed applications without installation information. It therefore doesn\u2019t distinguish between applications with the identical deployment information deployed to different paths. DeployedApplicationInstallationUsageSummary contains installation information, and it\u2019s therefore possible to target actions.
