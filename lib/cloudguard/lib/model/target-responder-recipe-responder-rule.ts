/**
* A TargetResponderRecipeResponderRule resource contains a specific instance of a
* single responder rule.
* <p>
A TargetResponderRecipeRule resource:
* * Is effectively a copy of a ResponderRecipeRule resource in which users can
* make certain changes if it\u2019s Oracle-managed, and other changes if it\u2019s user-managed.
* * Is visible on the Cloud Guard Targets, Target Details page.
* * Is effectively located in a specific OCI compartment, through the
* ThreatResponderRecipe resource to which it belongs.
* * Can be modified by users, programmatically or through the UI.
* * Changes that can be made here apply locally, to resources in OCI compartments mapped
* to the target that attaches the associated responder recipe (in a TargetResponderRecipe
* resource), and override any changes made in rules associated with the corresponding
* ResponderRecipe resource.
