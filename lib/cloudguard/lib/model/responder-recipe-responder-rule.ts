/**
* A ResponderRecipeRule resource contains a specific instance of a
* single responder rule.
* <p>
A ResponderRecipeRule resource:
* * Is effectively a copy of a ResponderRule resource in which users can
* make certain changes if it\u2019s Oracle-managed, and other changes if it\u2019s user-managed.
* * Can also be created by cloning an existing ResponderRecipe resource, either
* user-managed or Oracle-managed; cloning the ResponderRecipe resource also clones
* its associated ResponderRule resources as ResponderRecipeRule resources.
* * Is visible on the Cloud Guard Responder Recipes, Responder Details page.
* * Is effectively located in a specific OCI compartment, through the ResponderRecipe
* resource to which it belongs.
* * Can be modified by users, programmatically or through the UI.
* * Changes that can be made here apply globally, to all resources in OCI compartments
* mapped to a target that attaches the associated responder recipe (in a
* TargetResponderRecipe resource), but are overridden by changes made in the
* corresponding TargetResponderRecipe resource (which is effectively a copy of the
* ResponderRecipe resource).
