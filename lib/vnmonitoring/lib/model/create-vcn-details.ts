    * If you enable IPv6 for the VCN (see `isIpv6Enabled`), you may optionally provide an IPv6
* /56 CIDR block from the supported ranges (see [IPv6 Addresses](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/ipv6.htm).
* The addresses in this block will be considered private and cannot be accessed
* from the internet. The documentation refers to this as a *custom CIDR* for the VCN.
* <p>
If you don't provide a custom CIDR for the VCN, Oracle assigns the VCN's IPv6 /56 CIDR block.
* <p>
Regardless of whether you or Oracle assigns the `ipv6CidrBlock`,
* Oracle *also* assigns the VCN an IPv6 CIDR block for the VCN's public IP address space
* (see the `ipv6PublicCidrBlock` of the {@link Vcn} object). If you do
* not assign a custom CIDR, Oracle uses the *same* Oracle-assigned CIDR for both the private
* IP address space (`ipv6CidrBlock` in the `Vcn` object) and the public IP addreses space
* (`ipv6PublicCidrBlock` in the `Vcn` object). This means that a given VNIC might use the same
* IPv6 IP address for both private and public (internet) communication. You control whether
* an IPv6 address can be used for internet communication by using the `isInternetAccessAllowed`
* attribute in the {@link Ipv6} object.
* <p>
For important details about IPv6 addressing in a VCN, see [IPv6 Addresses](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/ipv6.htm).
