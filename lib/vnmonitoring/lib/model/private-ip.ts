/**
* A *private IP* is a conceptual term that refers to an IPv4 private IP address and related properties.
* The {@code privateIp} object is the API representation of a private IP.
* <p>
**Note:** For information about IPv6 addresses, see {@link Ipv6}.
* <p>
Each instance has a *primary private IP* that is automatically created and
* assigned to the primary VNIC during instance launch. If you add a secondary
* VNIC to the instance, it also automatically gets a primary private IP. You
* can't remove a primary private IP from its VNIC. The primary private IP is
* automatically deleted when the VNIC is terminated.
* <p>
You can add *secondary private IPs* to a VNIC after it's created. For more
* information, see the {@code privateIp} operations and also
* [IP Addresses](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPaddresses.htm).
* <p>
**Note:** Only
* {@link #listPrivateIps(ListPrivateIpsRequest) listPrivateIps} and
* {@link #getPrivateIp(GetPrivateIpRequest) getPrivateIp} work with
* *primary* private IPs. To create and update primary private IPs, you instead
* work with instance and VNIC operations. For example, a primary private IP's
* properties come from the values you specify in
* {@link CreateVnicDetails} when calling either
* {@link #launchInstance(LaunchInstanceRequest) launchInstance} or
* {@link #attachVnic(AttachVnicRequest) attachVnic}. To update the hostname
* for a primary private IP, you use {@link #updateVnic(UpdateVnicRequest) updateVnic}.
* <p>
{@code PrivateIp} objects that are created for use with the Oracle Cloud VMware Solution are
* assigned to a VLAN and not a VNIC in a subnet. See the
* descriptions of the relevant attributes in the {@code PrivateIp} object. Also see
* {@link Vlan}.
* <p>
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
* talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
* [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
