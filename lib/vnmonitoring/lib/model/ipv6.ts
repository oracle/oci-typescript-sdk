If your organization did NOT assign a custom IPv6 CIDR to the VCN for the private address

If your organization assigned a custom IPv6 CIDR to the VCN for the address space,

* the `ipAddress`. But the left 48 bits are from the IPv6 CIDR that Oracle assigned
* to the VCN.

This is null if the IPv6 is created with `isInternetAccessAllowed` set to `false`.
