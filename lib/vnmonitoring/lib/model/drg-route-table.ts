/**
* All routing inside the DRG is driven by the contents of DRG route tables.
* DRG route tables contain rules which route packets to a particular network destination,
* represented as a DRG attachment.
* The routing decision for a packet entering a DRG is determined by the rules in the DRG route table
* assigned to the attachment-of-entry.
* <p>
Each DRG attachment can inject routes in any DRG route table, provided there is a statement corresponding to the attachment in the route table's `importDrgRouteDistribution`.
* You can also insert static routes into the DRG route tables.
* <p>
The DRG route table is always in the same compartment as the DRG. There must always be a default
* DRG route table for each attachment type.
