/**
* For use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect. Each
* {@link VirtualCircuit} runs on one or
* more cross-connects or cross-connect groups. A `CrossConnectMapping`
* contains the properties for an individual cross-connect or cross-connect group
* associated with a given virtual circuit.
* <p>
The mapping includes information about the cross-connect or
* cross-connect group, the VLAN, and the BGP peering session.
* <p>
If you're a customer who is colocated with Oracle, that means you own both
* the virtual circuit and the physical connection it runs on (cross-connect or
* cross-connect group), so you specify all the information in the mapping. There's
* one exception: for a public virtual circuit, Oracle specifies the BGP IPv4
* addresses.
* <p>
If you're a provider, then you own the physical connection that the customer's
* virtual circuit runs on, so you contribute information about the cross-connect
* or cross-connect group and VLAN.
* <p>
Who specifies the BGP peering information in the case of customer connection via
* provider? If the BGP session goes from Oracle to the provider's edge router, then
* the provider also specifies the BGP peering information. If the BGP session instead
* goes from Oracle to the customer's edge router, then the customer specifies the BGP
* peering information. There's one exception: for a public virtual circuit, Oracle
* specifies the BGP IPv4 addresses.
