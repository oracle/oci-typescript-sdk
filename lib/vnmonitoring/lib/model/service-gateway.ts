* Storage without exposing the VCN to the public internet. Traffic leaving the VCN and destined
* for a supported Oracle service (see {@link #listServices(ListServicesRequest) listServices}) is
* routed through the service gateway and does not traverse the internet. The instances in the VCN
* do not need to have public IP addresses nor be in a public subnet. The VCN does not need an internet gateway
* for this traffic. For more information, see
* [Access to Oracle Services: Service Gateway](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/servicegateway.htm).
