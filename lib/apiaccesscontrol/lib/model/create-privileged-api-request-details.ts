/**
 * Oracle API Access Control
 * This service is used to restrict the control plane service apis; so that everybody won't be 
able to access those apis.
There are two main resouces defined as a part of this service
1. PrivilegedApiControl: This is created by the customer which defines which service apis are 
   controlled and who can access it.
2. PrivilegedApiRequest: This is a request object again created by the customer operators who           seek access to those privileged apis. After a request is obtained based on the                       PrivilegedAccessControl for which the api belongs to, either it can be approved so that the          requested person can execute the service apis or it will wait for the customer to approve it.

/**
* An Oracle operator raises privilegedApi request when they need access to any infrastructure resource governed by PrivilegedApi Access Control.
*   The privilegedApi request identifies the target resource and the set of operator actions. Access request handling depends upon the Operator Control 
*   that governs the target resource, and the set of operator actions listed for approval in the access request. If all of the operator actions 
*   listed in the privilegedApi request are in the pre-approved list in the PrivilegedApi Control that governs the target resource, then the privilegedApi request is 
*   automatically approved. If not, then the privilegedApi request requires explicit approval from the approver group specified by the PrivilegedApi Control governing the target resource.
* <p>
You can approve or reject an privilegedApi request. You can also revoke the approval of an already approved privilegedApi request. While creating an access request, 
*   the operator specifies the duration of access. You have the option to approve the entire duration or reduce or even increase the time duration. 
*   An operator can also request for an extension. The approval for such an extension is processed the same way the original privilegedApi request was processed.
