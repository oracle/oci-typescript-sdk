/**
 * Artifacts and Container Images API
 * Use the Artifacts and Container Images API to manage container images and non-container generic artifacts. 

- For container images such as Docker images, use the {@link ContainerImage} resource. Save the images in a {@link ContainerRepository}.

- For non-container generic artifacts or blobs, use the {@link GenericArtifact} resource. Save the artifacts in an {@link Repository}.
- To upload and download non-container generic artifacts, instead of the Artifacts and Container Images API, use the Generic Artifacts Content API.
For more information, see the user guides for [Container Registry](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Registry/home.htm) and [Artifact Registry](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/artifacts/home.htm).
