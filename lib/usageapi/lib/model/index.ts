/**
 * Usage API
 * Use the Usage API to view your Oracle Cloud usage and costs. The API allows you to request data that meets the specified filter criteria, and to group that data by the chosen dimension. The Usage API is used by the Cost Analysis and Carbon Emissions Analysis tools in the Console. See [Cost Analysis Overview](/Content/Billing/Concepts/costanalysisoverview.htm) and [Using the Usage API](/Content/Billing/Concepts/costanalysisoverview.htm#cost_analysis_using_the_api) for more information.
